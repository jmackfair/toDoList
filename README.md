# toDoList
A front-end only to-do list application built with Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JSS, and EJS.


The objectives of this project is to allow users to:
  1. Create a list of Tasks
  2. Add a new list item
  3. Cross off existing list items (but not delete them)
  4. Click on pages with different lists of tasks


**Note: Data will not persist between renders & tasks will not permanently delete since there is no database.
